        <h3>About Blood Donation</h3>
        <p>
            Blood donation is a simple, safe, and life-saving act. Every two seconds, someone needs blood,
            and one donation can save up to three lives. Blood cannot be manufactured – it can only come from generous donors like you.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Regular Donation Matters</h3>
        <p>
            Regular blood donations ensure a stable and sufficient blood supply at all times.
            It's especially critical during emergencies, surgeries, childbirth, and for patients with chronic diseases like cancer and anemia.
        </p>

        <h3>User Awareness</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Donate blood once every 3 months if you're healthy and aged 18–60.</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated, eat a healthy meal, and get enough rest before donating.</li>
            <li>Spread awareness among friends and family to increase the number of donors.</li>
            <li>Join local donation drives or register as a regular donor with hospitals and NGOs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Together, we can save more lives!</strong></p>
